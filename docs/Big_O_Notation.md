# Big $O$ notation
The "Big $O$ notation" is used to describe the complexity of algorithms.
# Types of complexity
The two most commonly analyzed resources are time and space.
## Time complexity
Time complexity refers to how an algorithm's execution time changes based on the input size.
## Space complexity
Space complexity describes the additional memory an algorithm needs as the input size increases. This excludes memory needed for the input data itself, but includes memory for loop variables, helper functions, temporary data structures, and the call stack during recursion.
# Complexity classes
## $O(1)$
Constant complexity
## $O(\log n)$
Logarithmic complexity
## $O(n)$
Linear complexity
## $O(n \log n)$
Loglinear complexity
## $O(n^{2})$
Quadratic complexity
## $O(n^{m})$
Polynomial complexity
## $O(2^n)$
Exponential complexity
## $O(n!)$
Factorial complexity
